## Overview

This project brings a playable synthesizer keyboard to the web with a modern and engaging interface. It features:

*   **Playable Interface:** Keys respond to mouse clicks, touch events, and computer keyboard input (standard QWERTY mapping provided).
*   **Audio Synthesis:** Uses Tone.js for generating polyphonic synth sounds with proper attack and release for sustained notes.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Keys animate and glow when pressed, providing satisfying visual feedback.
*   **Preset Tunes:** Includes buttons to automatically play various nursery rhymes, classical snippets, and Sargam (Alankar) patterns, with keys visually flashing along.
*   **Theming:** Offers a toggle switch for light and dark themes, with dark mode as the default.
*   **Indian Notation:** Displays Sargam notes (à¤¸à¤¾, à¤°à¥‡, à¤—...) on the white keys alongside standard notation.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile and tablet views, with horizontal scrolling for the keyboard on smaller screens.

The goal was to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing musical instrument in the browser, exploring React, Tone.js, and modern CSS while embracing the iterative "Vibe Coding" approach with AI assistance.

## Features

*   **Multi-Input Playability:** Play using Mouse Down/Up, Touch Start/End, or Keyboard Key Down/Up.
*   **Sustained Notes:** Implements `triggerAttack`/`triggerRelease` for notes that sound as long as a key is held.
*   **Visual Key Animation:** Keys depress and glow on activation using CSS transforms and pseudo-elements.
*   **Polyphonic Synth:** Powered by `Tone.PolySynth` for playing multiple notes simultaneously.
*   **Preset Tunes & Sargam:** Includes various melodies and Alankar patterns that auto-play with visual key flashing.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Smoothly transitions between a dark (default) and light UI theme using CSS variables.
*   **Notation Display:** Shows standard note names (C4, Db4...), computer key bindings (A, W, S...), and Sargam notation (on white keys).
*   **Responsive Layout:** Designed to work well across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React, Vite, Tone.js, and modern CSS.
*   **Iconography:** Uses `react-icons` for theme toggle and footer icons.

## Tech Stack
